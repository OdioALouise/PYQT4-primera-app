# This is our model. It will maintain, modify, and present data to our view(s).
# As this is read-only, it's pretty straightforward, but it can get pretty complex.
# This is something that Qt Development Frameworks/Nokia are aware of and working on, in terms of
# better documentation, as well as a better implementation of all this, but both of those aren't
# really within the scope of this tutorial. ;)
#
# For more information on list models, take a look at:
# http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qabstractitemmodel.html
# but do bear in mind there are other models (like tables) available, depending on your data needs.
# Again, beyond the scope of this tutorial for now. :)

 # We need to tell the view how many rows we have present in our data.
 # For us, at least, it's fairly straightforward, as we have a python list of data,
 # so we can just return the length of that list.
 def rowCount(self, parent = QModelIndex()):
  return len(self._items)

 # Here, it's a little more complex.
 # data() is where the view asks us for all sorts of information about our data:
 # this can be purely informational (the data itself), as well as all sorts of 'extras'
 # such as how the data should be presented.
 #
 # For the sake of keeping it simple, I'm only going to show you the data, and one presentational
 # aspect.
 #
 # For more information on what kind of data the views can ask for, take a look at:
 # http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qabstractitemmodel.html#data
 #
 # Oh, and just  to clarify: when it says 'invalid QVariant', it means a null QVariant.
 # i.e. QVariant().
 #
 # 'index' is of type QModelIndex, which actually has a whole host of stuff, but we
 # only really care about the row number for the sake of this tutorial.
 # For more information, see:
 # http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qmodelindex.html

  elif role == Qt.BackgroundRole:
   # Here, it's asking for some background decoration.
   # Let's mix it up a bit: mod the row number to get even or odd, and return different
   # colours depending.

   # (you can, and should, more easily do this using this:
   # http://doc.trolltech.com/4.6/qabstractitemview.html#alternatingRowColors-prop
   # but I deliberately chose to show that you can put your own logic/processing here.)
   #
   # Exercise for the reader: make it print different colours for each row.
   # Implementation is up to you.
